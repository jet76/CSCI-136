**Extra credit level 1.** Create interesting new level(s).

**Extra credit level 2.** Enhance your lighting algorithm so that opaque objects block what can be seen. Something along the lines of my version shown on the right.

**Extra credit level 3.** Make it so some tile types can be light sources of a given radius. On the video on the right, I made lava tiles generate light out to a distance of 2.5. The light should obey the same occlusion algorithm as for the Avatar's torch.
